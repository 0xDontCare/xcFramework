# xcFramework
The "eXtra C Framework" aims to provide set of various functions and structures which could be used in a wide spectrum of applications (from basic data structures and string manipulations to decoding and modifying image data (not included yet)).
Simply put, this repository is a personal playground for learning, practicing and creating general use toolset which could be reused later when needed in more complex programs and future projects.

## Currently available modules:
- Memory safer string and large set of functions for them

## Planned modules in near future
- Basic dynamically allocated data structures with various supporting functions
 - Arrays
 - Linked lists
 - Stack
 - Queue
 - Dictionary
- Basic linear algebra module
 - Matrices, vectors and their operations
 - Linear system solving
